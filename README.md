# UHAW: Unified Hardware for Automated Wholesale/Retail
UHAW: Unified Hardware for Automated Wholesale/Retail, is a desktop application designed to streamline the sales and receipt generation process for a hardware store. It acts as a point-of-sale (POS) system, allowing store personnel to quickly input customer purchases and generate a digital receipt (e-receipt).

## What the system does:
The system facilitates the transaction process by allowing users (store clerks/cashiers) to select items from an existing inventory file, input quantities, calculate the total cost, process payment details, and instantly generate a formatted e-receipt.

## Features
- Inventory File Loading: The system must be able to load product data (Item Name and Unit Price) from an external file (e.g., CSV, text file, or JSON).
- Sales Transaction Entry: A user-friendly interface to search for/select items, input quantity, and add them to the current transaction list.
- Automatic Calculation: Real-time calculation of sub-total, tax (if applicable), and grand total.
- E-Receipt Generation: Generate a structured, digital receipt (e-receipt) that can be saved, displayed, or printed.
- Data Persistence: The system will store transaction history (though the core inventory remains in the file).
